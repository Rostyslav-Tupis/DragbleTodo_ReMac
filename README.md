# Todo Board

A Kanban-style task management board built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The project allows users to create columns, add tasks, edit tasks, and drag-and-drop both columns and tasks. It supports both desktop (mouse) and mobile (touch) interactions.

## Features

- **Create Columns**: Add new columns to organize tasks.
- **Add Tasks**: Create tasks within columns using an input field.
- **Edit Tasks**: Double-click a task to edit its description, save with Enter or on blur.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Reorder columns and tasks via drag-and-drop on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Task Selection**: Select multiple tasks for bulk actions (mark as complete/incomplete, move, or delete).
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to mobile and desktop screens.
